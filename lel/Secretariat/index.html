        <h5>Pakistan National Assembly</h5>
		
		<!-- Information -->					
		<p>Adaab e Arz, delegates! I am Summiya Najam and I’m honoured to serve as your chairperson for Pakistan National Assembly at Bahria International Model United Nations. Before I start bragging about my achievements let me first assure you that you all are in safe hands. I’ve been through your position; secretly wishing that the dais skip my name on the general’s speaker list but trust me, I do care about the first timers. Now when you enter the National Assembly, I expect all the delegates to show the diplomatic side of their personality and handle issues like a diplomat. With that being said, I expect everyone to make this committee the most productive one. Be a diplomat, be a speaker and the award is yours *take note*. Now while making endeavours to make this committee the most productive one, I’ll assure you’ll have entertainment as well. Trust me, it will be more than the actual political scenario. Now a little about myself. I’m currently enrolled in A levels after ‘successfully’ ending my O level journey with a world distinction in world history and a national distinction in sociology *show off *. And I want to pursue my career as a lawyer. To follow my dream of entering politics I want to study International relations and soon will be on my track to serve Pakistan in a best way possible. I’ve been an avid speaker on politics, bagging awards in every MUN I’ve attended. I’ve been into parliamentaries as well. Off the record, if you really need the award, serve me Gol gappay, dahi bhallay or biryani and you’ll have one. Yes, my life is not complete without these. Ahem. Looking forward to see you all in september. Feel free to contact me on email: summiyan33@gmail.com Regards Summiya Najam</p>

		<!-- Information -->					
		<p>My name is Abdullah Babar and I will be chairing PNA at this year’s BIMUN. I’ve done my A levels from Headstart School. I have always been very passionate about debating and public speaking, especially MUNs and declamation contests. I’ve taken part in many debating competitions and MUNs, both in and outside Islamabad. I’ve participated at quite a few conferences and have won numerous awards. This is the 4th time I’ll be chairing a committee at an MUN so obviously I’m very excited about it. I expect all of you to be very well prepared and researched before you come to the conference. First timers should also try and research as much as they can before coming to the conference. On a lighter note, I will try and do my best to make the committee fun! Let’s make PNA the most entertaining as well as the most productive committee of BIMUN 2015!P.S. Congratulations to my bro, Murad on organizing this conference. My regards and best wishes to the host team
Looking forward to seeing you all!</p>

		<h4>Saad Sohail</h4>
        <h5>Special Political and Decolonization Committee</h5>
		
		<!-- Information -->					
		<p>Hello delegates!
I, Saad Sohail, feel strongly about chairing you this year at the forthcoming edition of Bahria Model United Nations 2015.
Having graduated in Marketing from the Lahore School of Economics, it is with great fervor that I welcome you all aboard. To me, my passion for public speaking sounds as old as my tongue. Having won over 14 best delegate awards, the WorldMUN Singapore held in 2011 inclusive of that, I hugely believe in the idea of taking on ambassadorial roles and working the rhetorical jazz as an effective channel for ending the deadlocks and bridging disparities – something that has instilled in me this ceaseless passion for MUN-ing. Taking it slightly off record, I also like Law and love (free) food.
Talking about the committee, SPECPOL is bound to tackle on-fire subjects, which undeniably makes it the most taxing committee there is. So, from my delegates, I expect real debating of some factual diplomatic appeal to voice the reasons which have led to the present-day debacles of militarization and remilitarization this world is currently fronting. This burdens our shoulders with the responsibility to work on the outright ingenuity of the issues. Being nonchalant in that regard is definitely not an option in the hall of SPECPOL
Let not that be all. Besides looking forward to struggling through the motions at hand, I foresee some next-level incorporation of wit which is expected to keep my brain’s pleasure centers entertained throughout the sessions. Also, you might not be the biggest diplomat there is, but you can always wear a pretty face to the meeting – that merger sure helps.
Pleasantly keen to meet you all at the conference. Together, let’s make it grand!</p>

		<h4>Salman Khan Niazi</h4>
        <h5>Special Political and Decolonization Committee</h5>
		
		<!-- Information -->					
		<p>Greetings Delegates,
Most of you know me.
For those who don’t, what were you doing till now, living under a rock maybe?
My name is Mohammad Salman Khan Niazi and I will the co-chairing the SPECPOL with Saad Sohail. Right now I am an ex-student of GSIS, having just finished my A levels.
I would love to brag about how many awards or gavels I have won, both domestically and internationally, but my job here is not to scare the living daylights out of you, the delegates, but rather to guide the committee to a reasonable outcome. Yet, rest assured: lie in front of me and I will humiliate and embarrass you. Most of the delegates looking over the website might think of UNDP as a fluff committee, a committee for novices and mainly for the delegates who are just coming to this MUN for “fun”. I assure you, we will have “fun” with numerous entertainment sessions but Rest assured this will be one of tougher committee in BIMUN and no I don’t mean it as a joke. If you sit quietly staring at the wall, wondering if the grass is truly greener on the other side, I will be the devil who interrupts your daydreams so that you can make the money you paid to the host team “halal” *pun intended even if there isn’t one*.In this committee we will be handing out awards based on your problem solving skills, diplomacy and innovative ideas. Brush up on your country’s history, current relations and reactions to global crises, that will truly help.
I love Masterchef, Agents of Shield, food*obviously*, dancing, gaming and lastly Jennifer Lawrence. Intellectually I love watching movies and reading about the CRM(civil rights movement) and anything that is not mainstream really. I am truly moved by Henry David Thoreau, Malcolm X, the movie the great debaters, The Godfather and Specially John Nash.
Looking forward to meet you guys in September.
Good luck.</p>

Sincerely,
Sarmad Rasheed Malik</p>

		<!-- Information -->					
		<p>Hello and welcome to Bahria Islamabad Model United Nations 2015. I’m Hadi Najafi and I’ll be chairing for Counter Terrorism Committee. I recently completed my A Levels from GSIS School & College Islamabad. I’ve been in the MUN circle since 2010 and over the time have attended numerous conferences as delegate, as well as committee director. I also have the honor of being part of the executive council twice at GSIS Model United Nations.
The topics for CTC are both very important and crucial. I expect a high level of debate in the committee so we can pass a practical good, practical resolution. I’ll do my best in aiding first time debaters and helping the speak up in the committee. Nobody in my committee will be allowed to remain throughout the sessions. If any delegate has any queries he/she can contact me on my email or on the Facebook group for our committee. Position papers are to be sent to me as soft copies as well as in hard copy form by the start of the second committee session.
The duration of and number of entertainment sessions in our committee depends upon the progress of the topic. As the chair, I will randomly select any delegate of my choice to entertain the committee so you better practice your dance moves. Looking forward for a grand 4 days with you people.
Happy Researching!

        <h5>Historic Tribunal For Kashmir</h5>
		
		<!-- Information -->					
		<p>“Hello everyone, my name is Hamza Bin Mazhar and I have the honor of serving as the chair of the Historic Tribunal for Kashmir at BIMUN this year. I did my middle school from Aitchison college Lahore, O-levels from BurnHall, and am currently doing my A-levels in economics, mathematics, sociology, and law from Roots College International.
I started going to debates and MUNs almost three years back, and my MUNing ventures have taken me to a total of about twelve MUNs out of which two were as a part of the secretariat and the rest were as a delegate. I have won a decent number too. Apart from that I work as a student leader for Global Zero, speak five languages, and love Chinese food and chocolate chip cookies.
Now that that awkward little introduction is out of the way, I would like to tell you all that you are United Nations delegates representing your individual countries. Act like it. I do not consider myself a strict chair, but I do expect competency and professionalism from everyone, as you shall find those same values in me.
Be prepared, be confident, and be punctual and I am certain we will have the best committee at BIMUN. I expect everyone to speak up and trust me we will make sure that that is the case. Also keep in mind that this is going to be a very unique experience provided that you do your research, so please be well prepared!
To conclude, I leave you with a quote I always find relevant for MUNs, “The key to success is confidence. The key to confidence is preparation.” So, the journey of BIMUN starts now. Godspeed and happy researching! May the force be with you, always. Looking forward to chairing for you at BIMUN!”
Best,
-Hamza Bin Mazhar</p>

		<!-- Information -->					
		<p>“Hello everyone! My name is Ahmed Bin Mazhar, and I am currently a third-year majoring in Accounting and Finance from the London School of Economics International Program. Most of my debating career is focused on parliamentary debates, and I have attended numerous competitions including the U19s, and judged a few as well including the national U17s. I am not a strict chair, but I expect everyone to bring their A-game.
 
Please know that we will not intervene unnecessarily in your debate, but we expect all of you to understand your words and all their implications. MUNs are about the quality of your argument, not the loudness of your voice. Remember to always be courteous and diplomatic.
 
In addition to that, it is important to realize that this committee is being simulated for the first time at any MUN conference in the world, and as a historic committee on Kashmir, it is very important that you research well on the politics, and geo-strategic and economic affairs of Kashmir and the South-Asian region as a whole back in the specified time period. The debate will revolve around economic, defence, and political matters, and it is pivotal to your performance that you comprehend these spheres fully and endorse them in your debate.
 
Lastly, delegates, we are going to have a very fun set of committee sessions and rest assured, each and every one of you is going to learn something from this MUN, and leave with awesome memories. Please do not be intimidated by the credentials of the members of the dais, we are here to help you and ensure that you have an amazing experience. So feel free to email me for any help you need with your preparation. (ahmeasy@gmail.com)
Happy researching!
See you at BIMUN,
 
-Ahmed”</p>

		<h4>Saad Shakil</h4>
        <h5>Social, Cultural and Humanitarian Committee</h5>
		
		<!-- Information -->					
		<p>Assalam-U-Alaikum. My Name is Saad Shakil and I am a first year doctor-in-training at The Islamabad Medical and Dental College. Having an extensive debating career which also consists of MUN’s in double digits; I take pride in introducing myself as the Committee Director of the GA3 (Social, Cultural and Humanitarian Committee) and wholeheartedly welcome the Diplomats of the World. “Model United Nations” the three words that were always music to my ears, the three words which instantly filled my body with adrenaline and finally the three words which only for a time being made me feel like a Super Hero , a Savior of the Planet. Trust me that was not always the case. On my first time, I too had sweaty palms and shivery legs rather I still experience that sensation whenever I enter the committee room but then again that is part of the experience- the experience which always ended up with a trophy in my hand with my name on it. If you feel the same, it’s absolutely normal just take a deep breath, relax and speak your heart out. My expectations out of the committee are Heated yet Logical Arguments, a lot of Desk banging, exciting entertainment sessions and finally a Resolution which actually makes sense. So prepare well, know your country’s stance and make this event memorable for you and everyone else.
Looking forward to Teach and learn.
Godspeed. Do well. Break a leg.
Saad Shakil</p>

		<!-- Information -->					
		<p>Hello and Welcome to the first edition of BIMUN. I will have the honor of Presiding over the proceedings of IAEA this year. My resume reads a healthy 25 Model United Nations Conferences, attended in various roles, over a span of more than a decade.
The agendas set for IAEA this year are both extremely important and complicated to sort out. The committee should ensure that the resolution(s) are designed in a manner that is both viable and practical. I will not be entertaining any resolution/paper that cannot be implemented in the real world.
All Position Papers are to be submitted to me by the START of the first session in a printed form. Many of you will notice that your printers will elope the night before the conference, hence please make prior arrangements. Delegates without position papers will be strictly reprimanded.
You can reach me at a.safwan90@gmail.com. Please refrain from asking for advice regarding your love life via email, we can discuss that later in the social events.
Happy Researching!</p>

        <h5>International Atomic Energy Agency</h5>
		
		<!-- Information -->					
		<p>Hey all! I am Mariam Bashir Chaudhary and as your chair, it is my distinct honour and pleasure to welcome you all to IAEA at BIMUN’15.
Currently studying at LGS I am an O’level student, however my association with Model United Nations extends to the past three years. I have had the honour of representing my institutions at 12 MUNS so far, and have been fortunate enough to receive various awards of diplomacy.
I love a heated debate and almost always choose a technical committee at the MUNs I attend, which is what I will be expecting from you as well. But I also want you people to have a strong base of general knowledge and international law. Polish up your diplomacy skills and may the odds be forever in your favour!
For the first timers out there, it can all seem a bit nerve wrecking at first but trust me a little hard work and confidence can go a long way and you should all actively participate in the committee and I’ll try to make it your best MUN. And for the frequent MUNers, I understand how we tend to get too serious about it all but koi nai tum log bhi thora shugal laga liya karo
BIMUN itself holds a significant place in my heart and after you leave it will hold a significant place in your hearts as well because of all the memories you would have made inshAllah!
Looking forward to witnessing a transformative engagement in diplomacy (and partayyy) by all.</p>

		<p>No, no. Not at all. I’m not in favor of clichés. Even when it comes to welcoming delegates. That’s the good part. All clichés, however, are true. That’s the bad part. So. Hullo, delegates! On behalf of the entire team of BIMUN, I, Syed Haziq Masood, would like to welcome you all to the International Crisis Committee. I’ve graduated from the Lahore School of Economics in Economics and Finance. Currently, I am a Business Development Manager for a software company. MUNs and I go along quite well; we’re pretty much friends with benefits. All sorts, that is. The essence to MUNning is to focus on each and every minute detail both within and outside the committee room. Don’t see. Observe! Don’t listen. Interpret! Don’t do either of these if you’re not making any sense, though.
I expect you not only to emphasize on research; but also to reproduce goods within the committee when it really matters. See you all in September!</p>

		<!-- Information -->					
		<p>Welcome Delegates! My name is Mahrukh Qazilbash and I will be serving as your Chair for ICC at BIMUN’15!
It was around 2 years ago that I attended my first ever Model United Nations conference where I won my first best delegate award. Between then and now, I’ve attended several MUNs, winning numerous awards and then chairing and adjudicating other conferences , while also taking part in the All Pakistan Debating Championships of 2014. I am now in my final year of A levels at LGS Islamabad.
The ICC is a unique committee, one where you won’t need any preparation, research, study guides or position papers. Instead, in this committee it’s your knowledge, creativity and ability to adapt to the most unexpected circumstances. And these are qualities I hope all of you will display at the conference! In the committee, I expect diplomacy, heated debate and decorum. And most importantly; suit up! See you all in January!</p>

I believe that platforms like Model UN & Parliamentary debates pave way for self exposure and actualisation for any individual whether young or old. So delegates, gear up for a ”heated” debate and some ”cool” diplomatic skills in WHO. Hoping to see you all in January 2015. NEW YEAR BEGINS WITH BIMUN!</p>

		<h4>Muhammad Hassan Bokhari/h4>
        <h5>World Health Organization</h5>
		
		<!-- Information -->					
		<p>Dear Delegates,
With great pleasure I welcome you to WHO at BIMUN 2015. My name is Muhammad Hassan Malik from the National University of Science and technology (SEECS) and I am honored to be your chair for the World Health Organization.
A brief background about me would include the fact that I completed my undergrad from GIKI in Electronics Eng. and am currently doing my masters; I have been largely affiliated with GIMUN (among other MUNs) owing to my uncanny interest into the concept of Model United Nations. This interest has led me through a journey starting from lodging delegates for the conference, to the committee itself as a delegate and then ultimately as the Secretary General for two MUN conferences. Not to mention my former post as the mun captain for GIKI.
Personally I believe a Model United Nation is more about cooperating with people rather than understanding the topics. It is an intellectually engaging and eye-opening learning experience for students of all shapes and sizes. This is mostly why you will find a range of age groups engaged with the conference in all forms. It will be an opportunity to meet a range of interesting and amazing people from around the world.</p>

		<!-- Information -->					
		<p>My name is Abdullah Khan and The Declaration of Human Rights has been my bible since I was fourteen years old. I feel honored to be serving as your chairperson for DISEC at BIMUN’15. What I have learnt in MUN, was not to fight, smash and exterminate your diplomatic enemy, but to negotiate, compromise and make concession to reach an agreement. This chair would of course encourage all the delegates to participate as enthusiastically as possible, taking active role during the debate. But would also like to stress each one of delegate to respect each other and refine their resolutions in more of rational and favorable way that the majority of the house could agree on, whilst not hindering each other’s national interests too much. Model United Nations and Parliamentary Debates form an integral part of my life and this is the 18th MUN that I am chairing.
I am currently in my last year of BSC economics in NUST Business School Islamabad. Apart from the obvious love for debate, I love cricket, football and am a diehard Arsenal supporter. My sense of humor and love for cheesy songs is something I am proud of. I look forward to four days of diplomacy, debate and entertainment!</p>

		<!-- Information -->					
		<p>Dear prospective PNA delegates,
Hello and welcome to the Pakistan National Assembly at BIMUN’15!
I am Zainab Samantash and I have been given the honor of presiding over the committee alongside my co-chair Asad Munir. I’m currently a final year student of LLB Hons., from the School of International. l have been an active member of Islamabad’s debating circuit for more than a decade now; having participated and won in numerous oratory competitions both within and outside of the city ranging from declamations to speech, MUN’s and parliamentary style debates, and moot courts to mock trials.
As for my experience in the Model United Nations’; I have won over a dozen of them in committees including DISEC, CTC and PNA. However owing to a profound personal interest in national politics, PNA remains to be my all time favorite committee. In addition, I have chaired seven committees previously, both UN and non-UN. I have also had the honour of serving as the elected Prime Minister of the first ever Children’s Parliament of Pakistan.
As for this committee, I expect ALL the delegates to have thoroughly researched and familiarized themselves with the topics given, so that they are equipped well enough to be able to contribute towards the debates.  More importantly, I expect ALL the delegates to fully participate in the discussion.
I look forward to a healthy and constructive debate.
Wish you all the best of luck!</p>
